                <p> I am a Ph.D. student in chemistry at The University of Chicago who loves people, going on adventures, and using computers
                to tackle tough problems. My desire to make computers work for me (and to avoid wet-lab) led me to computational work in college, 
                and in grad school, my love of statistics, communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences, and iterating to solve 
                tough problems, among other things, led me to become a Data Scientist. </p>

                <p> In the long-term, I hope to use my skills as a Data Scientist in the non-profit sector, leveraging data to help reduce
                inequality in urban centers. </p>

                <p> I am graduating in December with a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry. My work primarily 
                focuses on using computer simulations and statistics to study how protons (hydrogen ions) move through the M2 channel in the
                influenza A virus in order to help guide drug-design efforts. I have also done some really cool work using machine learning
                to develop new methods for running simulations of proteins. <a href="/about/projects.html">See more here.</a> </p>

                <p> Outside of data science, I am passionate about being involved in all the communities I find myself in, whether that's
                co-chairing a committee on department culture or volunteering at a nearby nursing home. I love running and reading, and 
                I cycle through other hobbies like knitting, playing the piano, and making cocktails. I am always learning something new. </p>

                <p> <strong> I am now seeking a Data Science job in Chicago! </strong> I am excited to continue extracting
                insight from data (messy and all) in the business world.
