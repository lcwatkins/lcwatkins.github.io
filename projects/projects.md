                    <h3> Machine Learning extension to Hyperdynamics </h3>
                    <p> Hyperdynamics is an Accelerated Molecular Dynamics method used to
                    "speed up" simulations, while still enabling direct and accurate calculations
                    of dynamic properies. This method is proven to be useful in "hard" systems, like
                    metal materials, but needs significant adaptations to be useful for "soft" systems
                    like proteins. In collaboration with Art Voter at Los Alamos National Laboratory, I
                    used clustering and classification techniques to begin development
                    of Hyperdynamics for proteins.

                    <h3> Proton-Induced Conformational and Hydration Dynamics in
                    the Influenza A M2 Channel </h3>
                    <p> The influenza A M2 proton channel is responsible for the
                    acidification of the viral interior after the virus enters a
                    cell--a critical step in the infection process. Here, we
                    performed exploratory data analysis with data from over 100
                    simulations to deduce the structural and dynamic changes
                    that accompany proton flux and enable channel activation. We
                    found that the protein structure shifts based on the proton
                    position, and demonstrated how the hydrated excess proton
                    stronly influences the water network throughout the
                    channel. </p>

                    <h3> M2 Inhibitor Binding Understood through
                    Mechanisms of Excess Proton Stabilization and Channel
                    Dynamics </h3>
                    <p> The influenza A M2 proton channel is drug target, and
                    two of the six available antivirals target M2, but
                    drug-resistance has rendered them ineffective. To help aid
                    new drug design efforts, we investigated how the adamantane
                    drugs inhibit M2 and found several key characteristics that
                    make these inhibitors effective. In particular, we compare
                    drug binding with proton stabilization in the channel to
                    show how these drugs take advantage of the channel's natural
                    ability to stabilize an excess charge. This work gives a
                    more dynamic picture of drug inhibition, with critical
                    implications for future drug design.

                    <h3> Multiscale Simulations of Proton Transport in M2 Mutant </h3>
                    <p> In this work, we use extensive Multiscale Reactive Molecular
                    Dynamics (MS-RMD) and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM)
                    simulations to model proton movement through a prevalent mutant of the
                    influenza A M2 channel. This mutant exhibits much higher
                    conductance compared to wildtype M2, and an altered pH
                    dependence. Using statistical mechanics to calculate the
                    free energy of proton transport, we investigate how this
                    mutation alters the proton transport mechanism and show the
                    key role of water.
