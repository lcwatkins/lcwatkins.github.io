                <p> I am a Data Scientist who loves people, going on adventures, and using computers
                to tackle tough problems. My desire to make computers work for me (and to avoid wet-lab) led me to computational work in college; 
                in grad school, my love of statistics, communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences, and iterating to solve 
                tough problems, among other things, led me to become a Data Scientist. </p>

                <p> I graduated in 2021 with a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry, where I 
                focused on using computer simulations and statistics to study how protons (hydrogen ions) move through the M2 channel in the
                influenza A virus in order to help guide drug-design efforts. I also used machine learning
                to develop new methods for running simulations of proteins. <a class="link-inline" href="/projects/projects.html">See more here.</a> </p>

                <p> Now at Kemper Insurance, I use advanced modeling techniques to unlock
                complex insight from messy data. My favorite project has been building
                Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to learn from car accident
                descriptions. </p>

                <p> Outside of data science, I am passionate about being involved in all the communities I find myself in, whether that's
                co-chairing a committee on department culture or volunteering at a nearby nursing home. I love running, reading, nerding out on politics, and 
                I am always learning something new! </p>
